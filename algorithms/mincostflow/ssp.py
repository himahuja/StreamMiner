	Returns the s-t min cost flow in graph G using Successive Shortest Path (SSP)
	algorithm. 

	* Note: Current implementation only works for undirected graphs.

	Parameters:
	----------
	G: rgraph
		A graph representing the knowledge graph.
	cost_vec: ndarray
		A vector of specifying cost to pass through each node. Shape: G.N
	s, p, t: int
		Source, predicate and target nodes. Predicate is used merely to create
		`flow.datastructures.flow.Flow' object when, not max-preflow, but max-flow
		is desired.
	npaths: int
		Threshold for maximum number of paths to compute.

		#		a flow from u to v would result in a backward edge from v to u with capacity
		#		equal to the flow sent on (u, v). However, in the case where we may have both (u, v) 
		#		and (v, u) from the same predicate, a flow along (u, v) creates an additional capacity 
		#		along (v, u), which may result in a total capacity that exceeds 1. However, since the 
		#		capacity captures a notion of similarity between predicates, we want it to be less than or
		#		equal to 1. We therefore make an assumption in this work that there is only
		#		an edge in one direction. Accordingly, once one of the forward or backward edges is used, we 
		#		set the capacity of the other edge equal to the flow sent along the chosen edge, which is the bottleneck. 
		#		This assumption does however mean that it may lead to different results. 
		#		Current implementation thus makes this simplifying assumption (i.e., old (v, u) value 
		#		is overwritten if it exists), and other ways can be devised in future work.]
